# THIS POST IS IN PROGRESS

In this blog post, I will try to enlighten some of the questions that a new candidate in this industry might stumble upon. I will build my points on my own experience being **fairly new**, therefore might this not apply to you. However, I'm sure that you can relate to at least, some of the upcoming points.

## :pencil2: Why even write about this?


So, why do I even care about writing this blog post? It's simple... I could have used some of these points when I was about to pursue a career in this industry. The industry is very complex, and there are tons of ways into this, which can make it hard for new people to join the spaceship. 

These new candidates might have fancy bachelor's degree from the University, vocational education, or be 100% autodidact - my point is, that they (to some degree), have the same fundamental way into this field.  


### :space_invader: My way onto the cybership
*If you don't want to read about my journey into Cyberspace, you can skip this part.* 

My way into this field has (maybe) been quite different, compared to what others might have done in the past, but nevertheless - I'm here now. 

**Let's start with my education.**

I graduated from Aalborg University with a BSc. degree in Information Technology in 2020. The degree was focused a lot on business continuity and evolvement within the IT industry. This gave me a lot of theoretical knowledge about *"how it should be done"*, but no practical experience, which might be valuable for a company.  However, as a side hustle, I worked as a Software Developer for a small start-up - where I developed some of the missing lack of knowledge. 

After i graduated, I was unsure whether to pursue a Masters degree, or go straight for a entry-level position. I knew that I wanted to work with security, and I knew that i had to get some more knowledge within this field. 

**So i had two options:**
1. Go for additional two years to University, to pursue a Masters degree in something "conventional". 
2. Apply for an entry level position within a security company. 

And while surfing the internet for open job listings, and degrees, I stumbled upon a new conscript the Danish Military is offering - Cyberv√¶rnepligten (*The Cyber Conscript*). 

I quickly read through the material, and immediately applied to this. Here in Denmark, you usually have to go through 4 months of conscript, but this education had additional 6 months of cyber-education untop - which for me sounded super interesting and fun. At that point, I hadn't served my conscript yet, and I found this opportunity a great way for me to take a year off, and think about my future - which turned out to be a great decision. 

I got accepted to the conscript, The Cyber Conscript, and for the first time had to experience what it was to be in the military - I had to get fit.  :muscle:

After serving 4 months in the Royal Danish Navy as the initial conscript, I moved to the Army to get my intensive cyber education. In the six months I served I got educated in:
- Networking(CCNA)
- Server administration (Win & Linux)
- Microsoft Active Directory Services
- Powershell Scripting
- Backup Solutions
- Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)
- Red teaming techniques and tactics
- And Incident Response

*There is probably something else to add to the list, but this was just what I had in mind.*

All these skills were used at the end of the conscript, on a week exercise. In this exercise, we had to act as System administrators for a whole battalion of actors, which exposed us to a lot of different cases. At the end of the exercise, we had to act as Incident responders, as our infrastructure got infected with widespread malware, which we later found out was ransomware. 

All of these skills touched upon a lot of different subjects that are widely used within this industry - at least this was a good way for me to get more practical experience and knowledge about the more technical aspects. 

Even before my conscript was over, I applied for an entry-level position, as a First Responder within the Danish Healthcare, at a huge organisation with over 35,000 employees to manage. I got the job based upon my understanding of *people*, *processes* and *technology*, but primarly my **drive to learn.** 

Now I have worked for this organization for 11 months, and really developed some valuable skills, because one thing is to get an understanding of the technical skills, but there are also soft skills to be added to your resume. 

For example, something simple as just working for a big organization, where everything is tied to processes, guidelines, and policies - was something new for me. Or the experience that I've gotten from the military where you had to work in different environments with people with different backgrounds and culture. 

Based upon these skills I got a new job as a Cyber Security Consultant in a private cooperation. 


**:stars: Enough about my way into cyberspace - let's talk about your opportunities.**
## :question: Endless opportunities
<img src="/assets/images/roadmap.jpg">
One of the questions that I hear a lot in this field, is what path to take if you want to work in this industry. It's a legitimate question, and I had it myself. This industry has so many different areas, and **the important part** is for you to do you **research**, and **test something** out. Do you think *vulnerability management* is interesting? - Spin up a VM with OpenVAS and try it out. What about *penetration testing?* It's easy for you to create an account on [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) and try to see if you can get access to some of the boxes. The only limit is you - there is tons of free ressources in cyberspace. 

Of course, you won't become an expert with these techniques, but you develop some fundamental skills to do further research and explore your interest. That's usually a valuable skill for the company you want to work for.

Don't get overwhelmed by the tons of options, I suggest you do the following:
1. **Write down your passion**. What type of work can you get lost in? What type of work could you do every day, and not get sick of? What interests you? Do you like solving puzzles and breaking into stuff - *Penetration testing* might be something for you. Do you like keeping yourself up to date with the latest breach reports - *Threat intelligence* might be something you fancy. 
2. **Write down your strengths & weaknesses**. What are you good at? Do you want to work with that, or do you want to evolve your skills in what you are not good at? These are questions that you need to address. And it can be very beneficial to work on your strengths, but occasionally it can be healthy to go out of your comfort zone.  
   
If you can enable yourself to go from just going to work because **you have to**, to going to work because it **interest you** - then you have found your right place.
