# THIS POST IS IN PROGRESS

In this blog post, I will try to enlighten some of the questions that a new candidate in this industry might stumble upon. I will build my points on my own experience being **fairly new**, therefore might this not apply to you. However, I'm sure that you can relate to at least, some of the upcoming points. 

***I hope you enjoy this post. Feel free to reach out to me.***

## :pencil2: Why even write about this?


So, why do I even care about writing this blog post? It's simple... I could have used some of these points when I was about to pursue a career in this industry. The industry is very complex, and there are tons of ways into this, which can make it hard for new people to join the spaceship. 

These new candidates might have fancy bachelor's degree from the University, vocational education, or be 100% autodidact - my point is, that they (to some degree), have the same fundamental way into this field.  


### :books: My background
*If you don't want to read about my journey into Cyberspace, you can skip this part.* 

My way into this field has (maybe) been quite different, compared to what others might have done in the past, but nevertheless - I'm here now. 

**Let's start with my education.**

I graduated from Aalborg University with a BSc. degree in Information Technology in 2020. The degree was focused a lot on business continuity and evolvement within the IT industry. This gave me a lot of theoretical knowledge about *"how it should be done"*, but no practical experience, which might be valuable for a company.  However, as a side hustle, I worked as a Software Developer for a small start-up - where I developed some of the missing lack of knowledge. 

After i graduated, I was unsure whether to pursue a Masters degree, or go straight for a entry-level position. I knew that I wanted to work with security, and I knew that i had to get some more knowledge within this field. 

**So i had two options:**
1. Go for additional two years to University, to pursue a Masters degree in something "conventional". 
2. Apply for an entry level position within a security company. 

And while surfing the internet for open job listings, and degrees, I stumbled upon a new conscript the Danish Military is offering - Cyberv√¶rnepligten (*The Cyber Conscript*). 

I quickly read through the material, and immediately applied to this. Here in Denmark, you usually have to go through 4 months of conscript, but this education had additional 6 months of cyber-education untop - which for me sounded super interesting and fun. At that point, I hadn't served my conscript yet, and I found this opportunity a great way for me to take a year off regular school, and think about my future.
