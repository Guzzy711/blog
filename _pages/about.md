Hi! :wave:

My name is Christian, and I'm currently working as a security professional for a Danish consultant firm. In my sparetime, I tend to do a lot of volunteering, as I sit as chairman in an association for cyber conscripts within the Danish army. 

I have a huge passion for Cyber Threat Intelligence, and usually allocate a lot of my late evenings to reading about the latest threats, and keep myself updated with the current landscape - *is this a military thing*?

When I'm not reading about Russian hackers, I try to keep myself fit, usually by *"hitting"* the gym, or going for a run. 

If you want to learn more about the association, you can find more on our website: [https://fdca.dk](https://fdca.dk)
